        I am a full-stack developer with a background in culinary arts. As a
        chef, my passion was wellness and sustainability. I knew that the
        tastiest and healthiest food came directly from local farmers and
        producers. Though I am no longer working in restaurants, I continue my
        journey to create a more sustainable culinary ecosystem as a software
        developer.

        My chef-like work ethic combined with my desire for change are what
        drives me while creating useful, modern applications.
